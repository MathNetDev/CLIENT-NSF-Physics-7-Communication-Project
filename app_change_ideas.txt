To adapt the communications project for another application, you have to do a variety of things to the code:

• Add socket calls for your application to work, passing its own variation of the data structure 
(this one would contain an object under username, instead of x and y). 
These socket calls will replace those for coordinate_change, so your page has to have some way to call them.

• Have your own application HTML file, and load that in the load in (if (current_path == '/groups')).

//TODO on that -- Add in a socket call to just load from what the server gives you as a file path, 
and the same for the associated functions with a .js file 
(for functionality like onclicks on their app -- otherwise the page will be mostly static)

• Add your own groups_info socket call equivalent, so your data can be updated on the page 
(it can obey the same table format, just you print different things in said table)
